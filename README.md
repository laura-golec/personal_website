# Hi, this is my personal website!
You can find it on www.lauragolec.com

## What technologies does it use?
This website is written using TypeScript. It uses the React and NextJS frameworks. It also uses TailwindCSS.

## How is it hosted?
Thanks for asking! It's hosted on my homelab linux server that I maintain myself. It uses a custom dynamicDNS script to update the records on my NameCheap domain. 

The server is fully self-hosted off of an old laptop I was gifted. It also runs all of my media backups and multiple other ~secret~ projects!

The reverse proxy hosting is handled by Caddy! 

## Why should you care?
I suppose you don't have to. However, if you are looking for a full-stack web developer then you should take a look at my website!
